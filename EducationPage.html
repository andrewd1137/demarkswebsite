        I attended University of New Haven in the Fall of 2017. From there, I completed my Degree in 4 years, graduating
        in the summer of 2021. I got my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I plan at some point, when I am ready,
        to go for my Masters Degree. Some of my favorite classes that I took during my Bachelors
        program were: Intro to web development, Computer Organization Lab (where we completed arduino projects),
        Algorithms, Intro to python programming, and Artificial Intelligence. Some of my other favorite classes that
        I took to graduate included: History of science, Digital systems, Linear algebra, Intro to world music,
        and Intro to music.
