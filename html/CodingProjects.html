                    <p class="bodyCaption">This is a project I did for my Artificial Intelligence class in college.
                        It consists of a "game board" on the left, and a tournament bracket on the right. The user
                        starts the games by clicking the play/next game/tie breaker button, depending on the
                        situation. The bracket is updated with the winner and each agent has their own "brain" working
                        behind the scenes. Agent0 has the smartest "brain" and should always end up winning. If you
                        would like to know more about this project, watch the video above for more details! I did
                        not make everything seen in this code. Some of the code is taken from past projects and
                        I found the template for the tournament bracket online (link for that is on github).

                        static web page for a made up company called Rockly, a Javascript circle program to calculate
                        various information about a circle, a Javascript greatest common divisor calculator, a Python
                        sentence and word scrambler, a C mini web pack like program, a C queue with a linked list, as
                        well as some arduino and other projects.
